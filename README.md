# 45-Day-Half-Marathon-Challenge
## Purpose
This repo serves the purpose of recording the training statistics and daily notes for preparing for my first half-marathon in 2021.
## Inspiration
As part of new year's resolution, I set the goal of completing one half-marathon race this year. Even though I have run half-marathons a few times before, I'd better make sound preparation for the next race because of the long gap from the previous one due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Besides, I have to confess that I am a procrastinator who needs supervision to push things forward. Well, inspired by [articles](https://medium.com/@adnanxteam/this-is-how-i-prepare-for-my-first-half-marathon-that-is-in-45-days-574ae421b5f8) written by Adnan, I decide to record training details in github repo, which is kind of self-supervision. :)
## Content
What I will document in this repo is the daily training data and self-review notes, including:
* The running distance
* The running time
* Pace
* Self-review notes
