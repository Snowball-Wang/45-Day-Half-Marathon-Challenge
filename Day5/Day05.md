# Day 5 notes

I have a very good sleep last night and I wake up at about 7 am. Honestly speaking, when you have a goal to achieve in the morning, you will probably not sleep in. Today I ran for 5.22 km with 31 minutes. The pace is 6 min/km, a little faster than the first run. I feel extremely hungry after the run, which matches with the some hearsay that exercise will increase your appetite.
