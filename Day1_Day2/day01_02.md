# Day 1 & 2 notes

Unfortunately, I had a huge fight over how to manage our income with my wife last night. It went on until beyond midnight. I went to work with only 3-hour sleep. However, I was quite amazed that I could still make some progress on work in the afternoon.  Coming back home and having a calm conversation with my wife, things got fixed and I felt extremely exhausted so I went to bed earlier than usual.

Day 2 was Saturday. It was such a sunny and beautiful day that I couldn't help thinking about getting a good nap and having a long run afterwards. But I can't because I made an appointment with my old buddy. After lunch we walked by the Xuhui runway and saw a lot of runners there. Frankly, I got envious of these people.

Obviously, it is a terrible beginning for the 45-day challenge. One lesson learned, life trivials will distract me from the goal I set. I have to adapt to all kinds of changes and make corresponding adjustment. That's all about Day 1 & 2.
